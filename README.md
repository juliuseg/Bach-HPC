# Improving Skeleton Consistency in 3D Medical Image Segmentations of Tubular Structures Using Deep Learning and Visual Analytics
s204427 Bachelor project 
## Contents
### Data_generation 
Are the files used for generating data. A job script is also in there 

### Local_Calculations 
Are my are calculations of different stuff: Testing data generation, generating angle plots, plotting model prediction samples and calucating the receptivefields of the different models

### Model checkpoints 
Have just one model, that is the default model so the reader of this file can test the inference of said model. 

### Skeleton_model/Evaluation
Is where inference is located. This can be called with the default model config: "Skeleton_g10_p1_gc03_l15_w15_dice"

### Skeleton_model
Have the training code called Train.py

### Rest of the code
is outside and these are files such as job scripts.
